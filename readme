	It offers a fast way to automatically merge a casually cropped image from a source image to a target image.


prerequisite:

	install triangle
	https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html
	use "./triangle/triangle -pq wang.poly" to create .ele .node .poly file
	use "./triangle/showme wang.poly" to show result
	
	On ubuntu:

	sudo apt install libx11-dev
	cd ./triangle
	make
	
	On mac
	
	brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz	
	cd ./triangle
	make
	
	
runing program:

	bash clone.sh <source_img_path> <target_img_path> <output_img_path>
	
	e.g. bash ./clone.py ../img/rabbit.jpg ../img/goat.jpg ../final/zoo.jpg

usage:

	When first display window pops up, crop a closed region in source_img, for example a rectangle, that you want to clone into target_img.
	The program would start to process your image afterward. This may take some time if your image is big.
	After processing, another window containing your target_img would show up. Move your mouse into the window and you would see the cropped image appearing in the window. It also may take some time if your cropped image is big. By clicking your mouse, the cropped image would be cloned into the target_img. You can do this multiple times. When you want to save your output and leave, press any key on keyboard.
